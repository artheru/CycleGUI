    Overview:

        Shader program 'ground_effect':
            Get shader desc: ground_effect_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: composer_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_composer_vs_position = 0
            Fragment shader: ground_effect_fs
                Uniform block 'uground':
                    C struct: uground_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_uground = 0
                Image 'uDepth':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_uDepth = 0
                Image 'color_hi_res':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_color_hi_res = 1


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader ground_effect = sg_make_shader(ground_effect_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'composer_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_composer_vs_position] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_uDepth = 0;
        SLOT_color_hi_res = 1;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'uground':

        uground_t uground = {
            .w = ...;
            .h = ...;
            .pnear = ...;
            .pfar = ...;
            .ipmat = ...;
            .ivmat = ...;
            .pmat = ...;
            .pv = ...;
            .campos = ...;
            .lookdir = ...;
            .time = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_uground, &SG_RANGE(uground));
