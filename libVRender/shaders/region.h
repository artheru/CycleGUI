    Overview:

        Shader program 'region3d':
            Get shader desc: region3d_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: region3d_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_region3d_vs_position = 0
            Fragment shader: region3d_fs
                Uniform block 'region3d_params':
                    C struct: region3d_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_region3d_params = 0
                Image 'region_cache':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_SINT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_region_cache = 0
                Image 'depth_texture':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_depth_texture = 1


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader region3d = sg_make_shader(region3d_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'region3d_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_region3d_vs_position] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_region_cache = 0;
        SLOT_depth_texture = 1;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'region3d_params':

        region3d_params_t region3d_params = {
            .vm = ...;
            .pm = ...;
            .viewport_size = ...;
            .cam_pos = ...;
            .quantize = ...;
            .face_opacity = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_region3d_params, &SG_RANGE(region3d_params));
