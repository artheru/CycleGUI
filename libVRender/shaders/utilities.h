    Overview:

        Shader program 'blend_to_screen':
            Get shader desc: blend_to_screen_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs_dbg
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_dbg_pos = 0
            Fragment shader: fs_blend
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0

        Shader program 'dbg':
            Get shader desc: dbg_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: vs_dbg
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_dbg_pos = 0
            Fragment shader: fs_dbg
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader blend_to_screen = sg_make_shader(blend_to_screen_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));
        sg_shader dbg = sg_make_shader(dbg_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs_dbg':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_dbg_pos] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;
