    Overview:

        Shader program 'holo_renderer':
            Get shader desc: holo_renderer_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: holo_screen_vs

                Uniform block 'lenticular_interlace_params':
                    C struct: lenticular_interlace_params_t

    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader holo_renderer = sg_make_shader(holo_renderer_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'holo_screen_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_idx_fine_caliberation = 0;
        SLOT_left_im = 1;
        SLOT_right_im = 2;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'lenticular_interlace_params':

        lenticular_interlace_params_t lenticular_interlace_params = {
