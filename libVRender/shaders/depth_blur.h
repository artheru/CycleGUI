            Get shader desc: depth_blur_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: depth_blur_vs

                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D

                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0

        Shader program 'kuwahara_blur':
            Get shader desc: kuwahara_blur_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: kuwahara_filter_vs

                    ATTR_kuwahara_filter_vs_pos = 0
            Fragment shader: kuwahara_filter_fs


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader depth_blur = sg_make_shader(depth_blur_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));
        sg_shader kuwahara_blur = sg_make_shader(kuwahara_blur_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'depth_blur_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {

                },

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'kuwahara_filter_vs':

            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'depth_blur_params':

        depth_blur_params_t depth_blur_params = {
            .kernelSize = ...;
            .scale = ...;
