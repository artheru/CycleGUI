    Overview:

        Shader program 'point_cloud_simple':
            Get shader desc: point_cloud_simple_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: point_cloud_vs
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_point_cloud_vs_position = 0
                    ATTR_point_cloud_vs_size = 1
                    ATTR_point_cloud_vs_color = 2
                Uniform block 'vs_params':
                    C struct: vs_params_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_vs_params = 0
            Fragment shader: point_cloud_fs


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader point_cloud_simple = sg_make_shader(point_cloud_simple_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'point_cloud_vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_point_cloud_vs_position] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_point_cloud_vs_size] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_point_cloud_vs_color] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params':

        vs_params_t vs_params = {
            .mvp = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_vs_params, &SG_RANGE(vs_params));
