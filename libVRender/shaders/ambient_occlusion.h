    Overview:

        Shader program 'ssao':
            Get shader desc: ssao_shader_desc(sg_query_backend());
            Vertex shader: blending_quad
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_blending_quad_pos = 0
            Fragment shader: ssao_fs
                Uniform block 'SSAOUniforms':
                    C struct: SSAOUniforms_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_SSAOUniforms = 0
                Image 'uDepth':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_uDepth = 0
                Image 'uNormalBuffer':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_uNormalBuffer = 1


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader ssao = sg_make_shader(ssao_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'blending_quad':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_blending_quad_pos] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_uDepth = 0;
        SLOT_uNormalBuffer = 1;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'SSAOUniforms':

        SSAOUniforms_t SSAOUniforms = {
            .P = ...;
            .iP = ...;
            .iV = ...;
